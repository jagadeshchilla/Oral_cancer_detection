    Oral cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
    Our system leverages deep learning models and image processing techniques to detect early signs of oral cancer from medical images. 
    Using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we can identify patterns and anomalies in oral tissues, providing healthcare professionals with a tool to support early diagnosis.
    
    ### Key Features:
    - Real-time analysis of oral cavity images for abnormal tissue detection
    - High accuracy in predicting potential cancerous regions
    - Easy integration with medical imaging devices
    - Secure and privacy-focused data handling

    By utilizing this technology, we aim to assist in the early detection of oral cancer, improving patient outcomes and survival rates.

    You can find more details and the entire project on my [repo](https://github.com/jagadeshchilla/oral-cancer-detection).
